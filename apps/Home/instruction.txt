dragon Type
--> separate route in dragon looks like autoban. not a browser on module federation. remove
      exposes: {
        './WelcomeToDragons': './src/WelcomeToDragons',
      }, and make it be handles in the new routing file
add that to autoban
add a /* to route paths in autoban

Add an Eden Button to the card that uses react router to route to a page that displays the full details of the dragon
in not a card format and has a back button Eden Icon at the top.
NOTE: For the routing to work in the host, and locally you will have to have the export of your
module federated app be different from a wrapper that includes the Browser Router (please look at Project Amulek for examples)
